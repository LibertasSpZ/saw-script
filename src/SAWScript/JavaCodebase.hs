{- Note [Loading classes from JIMAGE files]

The Java standard library is packaged differently depending on which version of
the JDK is being used:

* JDK 8 and earlier ship the standard library in <java.home>/lib/rt.jar, so
  loading the standard library's .class files is simply a matter of parsing
  rt.jar. The `jvm-parser` library is used to parse rt.jar like any other JAR
  file.
* JDK 9 and later abandon rt.jar and instead distribute the standard library as
  a JIMAGE file. (For more on the JIMAGE file format and how it compares to
  JAR, see https://stackoverflow.com/a/64202720.) In particular, the standard
  library is now located in a JIMAGE file at <java.home>/lib/modules.

We need access to the standard library's .class files in order to verify even
the simplest Java programs, so figuring out how to load classes from JIMAGE
files is a requirement for using JDK 9 or later in SAW. Unlike JAR, however,
the JIMAGE file format is internal to the JDK and subject to change in the
future. As a result, parsing JIMAGE files directly, like `jvm-parser` does with
JAR files, is likely not a good idea.

If parsing JIMAGE files directly isn't a viable option, what can be done? As
far as I can tell, there are only two reasonable ways of extracting .class
files from JIMAGE files (outside of using Java itself):

* Use libjimage, a C++ library bundled with the JDK, to load classes. This is
  what the JDK itself uses internally, and as a result, it's reasonably space-
  and time-efficient to load a single class from a JIMAGE file. Unfortunately,
  this is a non-starter for SAW due to potential linking issues that would
  arise when combining GHC with C++ code.
  See https://github.com/GaloisInc/crucible/issues/621.

* Use the jimage utility, shipped alongside java in <java.home>/bin, to extract
  the contents of JIMAGE files. The `jimage extract` command can either be used
  to extract everything in a JIMAGE file all at once, or it can be used to
  extract one class at a time, like in this example:

    jimage extract --include regex:.*/java/lang/Class.class --dir <output-dir> <jimage-file>

Since libjimage is an option, that only leaves jimage. Unfortunately, jimage is
not without its flaws:

* jimage is /slow/. It takes about about 1.5 seconds for jimage to extract the
  standard `modules` file on a reasonably performant machine. Having an extra
  1.5 seconds of lag every time that SAW is invoked doesn't sound appealing.

* What's worse, jimage is still unreasonably slow even if you only use it to
  extract a single class from a JIMAGE file. It takes about 0.25 seconds to
  extract java/lang/Class.class from the standard `modules`, which leads me to
  suspect that jimage is doing a linear scan through every file in `modules`.
  In any case, this is about 14Ã— slower than loading a class file from a JAR,
  and if SAW spends 0.25 seconds every time it loads any class from `modules`,
  this would add up very quickly.

What can we do about jimage's performance issues? One appealing alternative is
to use jlink, yet another utility that the JDK ships. If you give jlink a list
of Java modules, it will produce a minimal runtime environment that includes a
JIMAGE file that only contains the classes needed to support those modules, but
nothing else. In theory, this could cut down on the time it takes to extract
classes from a JIMAGE file, as the standard library's `modules` file is ~136 MB
when compressed (~493 MB when uncompressed), and most Java classes will only
use a small portion of that.

Unfortunately, jlink is even slower than jimage. It takes jlink about 3 seconds
to create a runtime environment that only contains the `java.base` module,
which cancels out any time saved when extracting the JIMAGE file afterwards.

Having exhausted all other possibilities, we have concluded that we simply
can't make JIMAGE extraction fast in the general case. We /can/, however,
amortize the cost of using JIMAGE files by caching the extracted contents.
This is exactly what SAW does. Any time that SAW tries to load a class
(e.g., java/lang/Class.class), it first checks to see if it is in a known cache
directory (e.g., ~/.cache/saw/<hashed-path-to-modules-file>/java.base/java/lang/Class.class),
and if so, loads it like it would any other .class on the classpath. If not,
it will then consult the JAR path and the classpath. If it is not located by
that point, then SAW will attempt to extract it from the JIMAGE file, caching
the result for subsequent lookups. Importantly, we perform the JIMAGE
extraction step last, as it is far more time-consuming that trying to load
classes from the JAR path or classpath.

There's still possibly some room for further optimization here. As mentioned
above, extracting one class at a time from a JIMAGE file takes about 0.25
seconds, while extracting the entire JIMAGE file takes about 1.5 seconds.
Depending on how many classes a program uses, it may take less time overall
to just extract-and-cache everything from a JIMAGE file at once. The downside,
however, is that the cache would require much more space. A typical JDK
`modules` file takes up ~493 MB of classes when extracted, but most simple Java
programs will only use <1 MB of these classes. As a result, we opt for the
one-class-at-a-time approach, which seems better tuned for the sorts of
Java programs that SAW verifies in common cases.
